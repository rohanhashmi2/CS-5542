In venture finance, price per share (PPS) is calculated by dividing the company’s pre-money valuation by the number of pre-money shares outstanding.
This value determines how many shares an investor receives for a given investment amount.

For SAFE conversions, the effective price per share is determined by comparing the valuation cap price and the discounted price.
The lower of the two prices is used, which benefits the SAFE investor.
This mechanism ensures that early investors are rewarded for taking on higher risk.

Accurate PPS calculations are essential for cap table modeling and ownership analysis.
Errors in PPS can lead to incorrect dilution estimates and misleading investor reports.
Therefore, PPS logic is a core component of any venture-finance modeling system.
