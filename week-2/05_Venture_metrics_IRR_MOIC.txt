Investors evaluate venture performance using metrics such as IRR (Internal Rate of Return) and MOIC (Multiple on Invested Capital).
IRR measures the annualized return of an investment over time, accounting for cash flow timing.
MOIC measures total return as a simple multiple of invested capital.

These metrics are typically calculated after a liquidity event such as an acquisition or IPO.
They depend on accurate ownership percentages and exit valuations.
Incorrect modeling of dilution or conversion can lead to misleading IRR and MOIC values.

Because these metrics rely on many upstream assumptions, traceability to source documents is important.
This makes them well-suited for retrieval-augmented generation systems with grounded evidence.
