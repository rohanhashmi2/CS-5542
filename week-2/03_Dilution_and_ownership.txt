Dilution occurs when a company issues new shares, reducing the ownership percentage of existing shareholders.
Although dilution decreases percentage ownership, it does not necessarily reduce economic value if the company’s valuation increases.

Ownership is typically expressed as a percentage of total fully diluted shares.
Fully diluted shares include common stock, preferred stock, options, and shares resulting from SAFE or convertible note conversions.

Modeling dilution correctly requires tracking both share counts and conversion mechanics.
Failure to account for instruments like SAFEs can significantly misstate true ownership.
As a result, dilution modeling is a critical use case for document-based financial analysis systems.
