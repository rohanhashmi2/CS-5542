Edge cases in venture finance often arise when documents omit key terms or contain ambiguous language.
For example, a SAFE may reference a valuation cap without clearly defining the capitalization basis.
This ambiguity can lead to multiple reasonable interpretations.

Another edge case occurs when multiple SAFEs with different terms convert in the same financing round.
The interaction between valuation caps, discounts, and new investor pricing can be complex.
Without clear documentation, automated systems may struggle to produce confident answers.

Handling ambiguity requires systems to either ask clarifying questions or surface assumptions explicitly.
This makes ambiguous queries an important test case for advanced RAG pipelines.
