A SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) is an investment instrument commonly used in early-stage venture financing.
Unlike traditional debt, a SAFE does not accrue interest and does not have a maturity date.
Instead, it converts into equity upon a future triggering event, typically a priced equity financing.

Key terms in a SAFE include the valuation cap, discount rate, and most-favored-nation (MFN) clause.
The valuation cap sets a maximum company valuation at which the SAFE will convert, protecting early investors from excessive dilution.
The discount rate allows the SAFE holder to convert at a lower price per share than new investors in the triggering round.

SAFEs are popular because they are simpler than convertible notes and reduce legal complexity.
However, they can create uncertainty around ownership percentages until conversion occurs.
Understanding how SAFEs convert is critical for modeling dilution and post-money ownership.
