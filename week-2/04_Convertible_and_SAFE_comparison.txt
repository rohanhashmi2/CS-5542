Convertible notes and SAFEs are both instruments used to delay valuation in early-stage investments.
Convertible notes are debt instruments that accrue interest and have a maturity date.
If the note does not convert by maturity, repayment may be required.

SAFEs, by contrast, are not debt and do not accrue interest.
They convert only upon defined trigger events and typically include fewer legal obligations.
This simplicity has made SAFEs more popular in seed-stage fundraising.

Despite their simplicity, SAFEs can create complex capitalization outcomes when multiple SAFEs exist with different terms.
Comparing SAFEs and convertible notes is important for understanding investor rights and risks.
